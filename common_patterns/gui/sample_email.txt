RATE PLAN SUMMARY 
Phone Plans (effective from 21 November 2016)
	Price per month per device
MBIE Phones	$22.00
Datacard, Mi-Fi, iPads	NIL
Managed Mobile (VSDM Vodafone
Security Device Management)	$4.00
Unlimited calling/texting to standard NZ and Australian Landlines and cell phones*	Nil; included in monthly fee
BYOD (VSDM Vodafone
Security Device Management)	$5.00
Data Usage charge
   Up to 500MB per month
   Above 500MB	
$10.00 per GB
$14.00 per GB
Notes:
1 GB = 1024 MB
*Unlimited talk and TXT is for standard person-to-person calls and TXTs to standard NZ numbers and to standard Australian numbers. Excludes use overseas and premium and special numbers. As long as you’re talking to another person, or using your fingers to TXT them, unlimited talk and TXT is for you. However, unlimited talk and TXT is not for multiple simultaneous calling, re-supply, call centre usage, telemarketing, bulk messaging, application-to-person communication, continuously call forwarding, auto-dialling, machine to machine communication (including by using your SIM card in any other device) Cellular Trunking Units (CTUs), or any other activity that Vodafone considers to be non-standard usage. Unlimited talk and TXT does not include calls or TXTs to Australian external territories (including Norfolk Island) or satellite services.
   

An example of how the Data Usage charge will work:
•	If no data is used then there is no charge.
•	If less than 500MB per device is used in a month, the charge will be the amount of data used at $10/GB. 
e.g. if 300MB used the charge is $2.93.
•	If more than 500MB per device is used in a month, then the charge will be $10/GB for the first 500MB 
plus $14/GB for any data used in excess of 500MB. 
e.g. if 650 MB of data per device is used the charge is $6.93 ($4.88 for 500MB and 150MB x $14/GB = $2.05).
